Code Challenge #7

Look at the image named grid.jpg. Using Bootstrap, recreate this grid in the index.html file. Commit your changes when you are finished. 

Reminders: 
All your columns should have col-12 if you want them to be 100% on mobile.
If you have a column that is narrower on desktop, you should ALSO have a "col-sm-#" class in addition to the col-12. New Bootstrap is mobile first.

Nest Like This:
Container
  Row
    Column
